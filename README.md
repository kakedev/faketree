# Fake Tree
FakeTree is a fake TREE cmd command for sacammer trolling.

FakeTree is very simple to use. After you install it all you need to do is run TREE on your CMD window, it will show the message "Press any key to start NETWORK and FILE diagnosis..." then you press any key and it will start the tree command. After you'll view a box saying that no viruses were found, all connections are safe and that your firewall is up and running.

# Installation
It's very simple to install, chose the x86 or x64 (according to your system) version and copy it. Go to System32 directory and paste it, still in System32 delete "tree.com" file (PLEASE BACK IT UP IF YOU'RE NOT IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE). Go back to the app folder and copy "Colorful.Console.dll" and paste it into System32.
